# Gonzales

*¡Ándale, ándale! A mouse profile manager for Windows. The best-paced mouse in all unicode!*

It's no secret people like to use their mice in different ways. Don't fight it, embrace it!

![Hello, computer?](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btVRbshbbaC8Ygg/giphy.gif)

**Save multiple mouse profiles and switch between them at will.**

### *Why might I need this?*

* Do you need different mouse sensitivity for work and play?
* Do your mouse and trackpad seem to live in different timezones?
* Do you share your computer with several people, each with different preferences and abilities!!?

If you value your treasury, don't buy an adjustable DPI mouse; download Gonzales instead!

* Customise mouse pointer speed and acceleration (a.k.a *enhanced pointer precision*)

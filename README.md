*¡Ándale, ándale! A mouse profile manager for Windows. The best-paced mouse in all unicode!*

## About

It's no secret that people like to use their mice in different ways.
Don't fight it, embrace it!

![Hello, computer?](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btVRbshbbaC8Ygg/giphy.gif)

Save multiple mouse profiles and switch between them at will.

### *Why might I need this?*

* Do you need different mouse sensitivities for work and play?
* Do your mouse and trackpad seem to live in different timezones??
* Do you share your computer with several people, each with different preferences and abilities???

If you value your treasury, don't buy an adjustable DPI mouse; download Gonzales instead!

### Features

* Adjust mouse pointer speed and acceleration (a.k.a *enhanced pointer precision*)
* Create and manage mouse pointer profiles
* Switch between profiles at any time via the system tray icon
